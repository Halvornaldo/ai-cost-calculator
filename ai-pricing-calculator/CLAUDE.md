# AI Pricing Calculator - CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the AI Pricing Calculator project.

## Project Identity
**IMPORTANT**: This is the AI model pricing comparison tool, NOT the SMB cost savings calculator.

## Project Overview
A calculator that helps developers and businesses compare pricing between different AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.) based on token usage and estimate their AI API costs.

## What This Calculator Does
- Compares pricing across AI providers
- Calculates costs based on token usage
- Shows price differences between models
- Helps choose most cost-effective AI solution
- Estimates monthly/annual AI API expenses

## User Journey
1. Select AI models to compare
2. Input expected usage (tokens/requests)
3. View cost comparisons and projections
4. Get optimization recommendations
5. Export results for decision making

## Current Status
- Phase 1 completed and live at portfolio site
- Includes 10+ AI models with pricing data
- 3-step wizard interface implemented
- Cost comparison features working

## Target Audience
- Developers evaluating AI APIs
- Technical teams making AI decisions
- Businesses comparing AI costs
- Anyone estimating AI API expenses

## Key Features Built
- Model selection interface
- Usage input calculator
- Cost comparison charts
- Export functionality
- Optimization tips

## Tech Considerations
- Currently integrated into portfolio website
- May need extraction to standalone project
- Focus on accurate, up-to-date pricing
- Technical audience = more detailed options OK

## Note
This project is separate from the AI Cost Savings Calculator. Keep these projects clearly distinguished to avoid confusion.
