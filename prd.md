## Narrative

As a small business owner, I discover the AI Cost Savings Calculator through a targeted LinkedIn ad promising to show me exactly how much money AI could save my business. Intrigued but skeptical, I click through to find a professional, straightforward tool that asks me simple questions about my business operations. I select my industry from a dropdown, indicate I have 12 employees, and begin walking through each operational area. For customer service, I input that my team spends 15 hours per week handling routine inquiries at an average wage of $18 per hour. The calculator immediately shows me potential savings as I complete each section. By the time I finish, I'm amazed to see that automating just three key processes could save my business over $47,000 annually. The detailed breakdown shows me exactly which AI tools to consider and provides a realistic timeline for implementation. When prompted to enter my email for a comprehensive report, I don't hesitate because the tool has already delivered tremendous value. The follow-up email includes not only my detailed report but also information about a practical AI course that could help me implement these solutions effectively. For the first time, AI feels accessible and financially justified for my business.
